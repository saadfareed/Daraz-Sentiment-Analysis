## Sentiment analysis of Daraz Product Reviews
Note: This is one of my ML Project.

Daraz is the leading online marketplace in South Asia, empowering tens of thousands of sellers to connect with millions of customers. Daraz provides immediate and easy access to 22 million products in 100+ categories to deliver more than 2 million packages every month to all corners of the country.

There are thousands of reviews for thousands of products on Daraz right now. In this project, we scrapped 2000+ reviews from Daraz for various products of the same category to find out the sentiments of the users about the category.
